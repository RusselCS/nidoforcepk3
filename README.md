source files for Nido Force at IGMC 2015

Written by Micah West on May 20, 2017

Welcome! This is a very old repository, about two years old as of the day I put it up here.

This game is a mod of a fork of a Doom engine, so all of its code is interpretted at runtime.
It's also poorly documented due to the time crunch I was on when I wrote most of it.

Feel free to poke around at your leisure. Note that this game was designed to run with a modified version of GLOOME, 
which, in turn, is a modified version of GZDoom. You can find a repository for both GLOOME and documentation on how
to compile and run it yourself, or you can just download the game from the urls below.

Thanks!

                                       Ultimately obsolete now, since GZDoom itself is now GPL-compliant and
                                       can thus be sold commercially alongside commercial modifications.

                                        for countless mods and total conversions.
